            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control works like a library. It stores files that can be accessed by those with a library card. Those who check out the files are allowed to modify them. Collaborators like to use version control because it ensures that every version of the files will be saved. This allows collaborators to work efficiently. If a problem were to surface within a project, they would not have to start from scratch. The version control system should tell exactly what changes were made to each version of the file. In other words, it allows them to pinpoint the source of the problem.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Without a version control system, team members work apprehensively. If something were to go wrong, their work could be lost in an instant. Version control systems ensure a smooth collaboration process. They are ideal for extensive projects that are orchestrated by a team of collaborators. A version control system will take inventory of modifications made to project files. It then backs them up once they are committed (or saved). Collaborators of a project can view what changes were made within a file, when they were implemented and who authorized them. They will also always know what the most up-to-date version of the files looks like.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of distributed version control system or DCVS. Instead of listing all of the alterations made to the files, Git will store them in the form of a picture. It captures what your file looks like in that point in time. Git is popular because it does not have to draw from remote servers to retrieve information. Each team member has a copy of the repository –meaning the project’s files and the revision history – on his or her server. This is an advantage because members have the ability to work offline. Collaborators are comforted in knowing that their work will be backed up amongst their team.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As aforementioned, work can be conducted on Git on an individual’s local machine. Members can, for the most part, operate Git commands offline until they decide to share the repository. Local operations allow them to alter files in their working directory. This is similar to putting groceries into a shopping cart and then deciding what you want to keep. Then, you stage the files. This is where the alterations take place; you decide that you should replace the cookies with celery. Finally, the altered state of the file is placed in the staging area. The file is captured in a snapshot and committed to the Git directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git allows team members to perform operations on a local machine before sharing what has been committed to their repository. Using the git remote command, they can share commits with the main repository. The term used for this operation is “pushing”. Members can also draw commits from the main repository by using the git fetch command. In the collaborative process, it is important to review others’ work. The fetch command will show you how the other members have progressed. After reviewing them, there is the option to combine the commits with the contents of the local repository. They can then be sent back to the central repository.</p>
